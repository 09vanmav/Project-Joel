<p>HaRav Moshe di Trani was born in 5265/1505 in the city of
Salonica/Thessaloniki, Greece. His father, Yosef, had been
expelled from Trani, the city of his birth, in the Apulia/Puglia
region of Italy in 5262/1502 and had fled to Salonica.</p>
<p>The family traced their ancestry back to Rabbi Yeshayah di Trani,
more commonly known as the Tosfos Rid.</p>
<p>While still a boy Moshe was sent to
Adrianople/Edirne to learn Gemara under the
supervision of his uncle Aharon. It was there that
Moshe first made the acquaintance of Rav Yosef
Caro (the Beis Yosef).</p>
<p>At the age of sixteen Moshe then travelled to
Tzfat/Safed and learnt under Rav Yaakov Beirav,
becoming his talmid muvhak.</p>
<p>In 5285/1525 he was appointed as a dayan on the local Beis Din, a
position he held for 54 years. During this period, alongside Rav Yosef
Caro, they replied to many halachic queries from all over the world,
as well as having a number of famous disagreements (e.g. the status
of fields owned by non-Jews during shemittah).</p>
<p>In 5298/1538, Rav Yaakov Beirav attempted to re-establish semicha, based on Rambam's
ruling (Sanhedrin 4:11) that if all the rabbonim of Eretz Yisrael agreed to appoint a leading
dayan, he would officially be allowed to pasken monetary rulings and give over semicha to
others. A renewed semicha would allow for the creation of a Sanhedrin, which in turn could
give malkus, creating an opportunity for the many Marranos to erase the sins of their former
lives that deserved kares. All the rabbis in Tzfat, including Rav Moshe, agreed to the plan,
appointing Rav Yaakov Beirav as head dayan. He later passed down his semicha to his four
main talmidim; Rav Moshe, Rav Yosef Caro, Rav Moshe Cordorvero and Rav Yosef Sagis.</p>
<p>However, due to strong opposition from Rabbi Levi ben Chaviv, Rabbi Yakov Beirav was
forced to leave Tzfat, moving to Damascus and the semicha initiative collapsed.</p>
<p>After the passing of Rabbi Yosef Caro, Rav Moshe served as the sole head of the Tzfat beis
din for five years, before moving to Yerushalayim at the end of his life.</p>
