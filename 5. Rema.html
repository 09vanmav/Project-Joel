    <hr />
        <p>Rabbi Moshe was born in Kraków, Poland. His father,
        Yisrael ben Yosef (known as Isserle), was a prominent
        talmudist and independently wealthy; his grandfather,
        Yechiel Luria, was the first rabbi of Brisk.</p>
        <p>He studied in Lublin under Rabbi Shalom Shachna,
        who would later become his father-in-law. Among his
        fellow pupils were his relative Rabbi Shlomo Luria
        (Maharshal), who would later disagree with many of
        Rabbi Moshe's halachic rulings, and Chaim ben Bezalel, an older brother of Rabbi Juah
        Loew (Maharal).</p>
        <p>His first wife died young, at the age of 20 and he later established the "Rema Synagogue" in
        Krakow in her memory (originally his house, built by his father in his honour, which he gave
        to the community). He later married the sister of Yosef ben Mordechai Gershon Ha-Kohen.</p>
        <p>He returned to Krakow in c.1550, establishing a large yeshiva where as a wealthy man, he
        supported his pupils. In his teaching, he was opposed to pilpul and emphasised simple
        interpretation of Gemara. In 1553 he was appointed as dayan; he also served on the Council
        of the Four Lands. He became a world-renowned scholar and was approached by many
        other well-known rabbis, including Rabbi Yosef Caro, for halachic decisions. He was one of
        the greatest Jewish scholars of Poland, and was the primary halachic authority for European
        Jewry of his day.</p>
        <p>He died in Krakow and was buried next to his synagogue. On his tombstone is inscribed:
        "From Moshe (Maimonides) to Moshe (Isserles) there was none like Moshe".</p>
        <p>Not only was Rabbi Moshe a renowned Talmudic and legal scholar, he was also learned in
        Kabbalah, and studied history, astronomy and philosophy. He taught that “the aim of man is
        to search for the cause and the meaning of things”. He also held that "it is permissible to
        now and then study secular wisdom, provided that this excludes works of heresy... and that
        one [first] knows what is permissible and forbidden, and the rules and the mitzvot".
        Maharshal reproached him for having based some of his decisions on Aristotle. His reply
        was that he studied Greek philosophy only from Rambam's Moreh Nevuchim, and then only
        on Shabbos and Yom Tov; and furthermore, it is better to occupy oneself with philosophy
        than to err through Kabbalah.</p>

    <h3>Seforim</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Darchei Moshe, a commentary on Tur and Beis Yosef. Rabbi Moshe had originally
            intended this to serve as a basis for subsequent halachic decisions. As such, in this
            work he evaluates the rulings of the Tur, widely accepted among Ashkenazim and
            Sephardim, comparing these with rulings of other halachic authorities. Beis Yosef
            was published while he was writing Darchei Moshe. Recognizing that the
            commentary largely met his objectives, he published Darchei Moshe in a modified
            form.</li>
            <li>HaMapah, written as a gloss to Shulchan Aruch, discussing cases where Sephardi
            and Ashkenazi customs differ. Rabbi Yosef Caro had based his normative positions
            on three authorities: Rambam, Asher ben Yechiel (Rosh), and Yitzchak Alfasi (Rif).<br />
            Of these, only Rosh had non-Sephardic roots, having lived most of his life in
            Germany before moving to Spain, but even so, his work is largely Sephardic in
            orientation. Rabbi Moshe thus created a series of glosses, in which he supplemented
            with material drawn from the minhagim of Ashkenazi Jewry, chiefly based on the
            works of Yaakov Moelin, Israel Isserlein and Israel Bruna.</li>
            <li>Toras haChatas, a legal guidebook focusing primarily on Jewish dietary laws.</li>
            <li>Toras haOlah, an in-depth philosophical explanation of the significance of the Beis
            HaMikdash in Yerushalayim and of its rites.</li>
            <li>Mechir Yayin, a commentary on the Book of Esther.</li>
            <li>Teshuvot Rema, a collection of responsa.</li>
        </ol>
