    <h1>Rabbi David ibn Zimra</h1>
    <h2>The Radvaz</h2>
        <p>5239/1479 - 5333/1573</p>
    <hr />
        <p>Rabbi David was born in Spain in 1479. He was thirteen years old in 5252/1492 when Jews
        were banished from Spain. His parents moved to Tzfat/Safed, where he learnt under the
        Tzaddik Halavan/Tzaddik Hatarngolim Rabbi Yosef Saragossi.</p>
        <p>At the age of 31, he left Eretz Yisrael and travelled to Fez, Morocco, where he became a
        member of the beis din, presided over by the naggid, Yitzchak HaKohen Sholal. When the
        Turkish government abolished the office of the naggid in 5277/1517, after a short stay in
        Alexandria, he moved to Cairo where he was appointed Chacham Bashi, Chief Rabbi of
        Egypt, a position he held for 40 years. He was not only dayan, but also head of the yeshivah,
        trustee of the hekdesh and administrator of charity collections (gabbai tzedakah).</p>
        <p>Independently wealthy, Rabbi David was a successful merchant with business connections
        in many countries. He was highly revered for his vast knowledge, integrity and extensive
        philanthropy. The yeshiva which he founded and supported attracted many illustrious talmidim,
        including Rabbi Betzalel Ashkenazi and Rabbi Yitzchak Luria.</p>
        <p>He was prominent in both the social and political life of Egypt and introduced many reforms
        to the everyday life and religion of the Egyptian Jews, which brought about a spiritual revival
        in the communities of Cairo and Alexandria.</p>
        <p>One of the changes that he reintroduced was to have the sheliach tzibbur repeat the Amidah
        aloud after the congregation had said the silent Amidah. He had found that the Egyptian
        Jews had been following a minhag for the congregation not to say the Amidah silently for
        themselves but said it aloud jointly with the sheliach tzibbur. This led to many congregants
        who were not paying full attention to fail to recite the Amidah at all.</p>
        <p>Another important change was to abolish the use of the Seleucid dating system, the old
        Jewish civil calendar which had been in use amongst Egyptian and Babylonian Jews since
        the time of the second Beis Hamikdash. It had become the norm to date documents from the
        reign of Alexander of Great and the Syrian kings that followed him, as had previously been
        the minhag with the Jewish kings (minyan shtaros). He reintroduced the dating of years from
        the creation of the world, as was done in other Jewish communities.</p>
        <p>He formed a chevra kadisha, and banned employing non-Jews as dancers or musicians at
        Jewish weddings.</p>
        <p>At the age of 90, he retired from the chief rabbinate and divided most of his wealth amongst
        the poor, making special provisions for talmidei chachamim. He moved to Yerushalayim, but
        soon moved to Tzfat due to the burdensome taxes the Ottoman Empire had imposed on the
        Jews. He became an active member of the beis din of Rabbi Yosef Caro.</p>
