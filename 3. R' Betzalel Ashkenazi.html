    <h1>Rabbi Betzalel Ashkenazi</h1>
        <p>5280/1520 - 5350/1590</p>
    <hr />
        <p>Descended from a family of German scholars as indicated by the family name Ashkenazi,
        very little is known about the early years of Rabbi Betzalel. His father, Avraham, travelled to
        Eretz Yisrael from Germany and settled in either Yerushalayim or Tzfat, where Rabbi
        Betzalel was born. Due to a lack of funds, his father was forced to emigrate with his family
        down to Egypt, where he supported himself as a rabbi and a teacher.</p>
        <p>The greater part of his life was spent in Egypt where he was first a talmid of Rabbi David ibn
        Abi Zimra (Radvaz), who was the chief rabbi of the community. Already whilst Radvaz was
        still in Egypt, Rabbi Betzalel was regarded as one of the highest authorities in the region and
        he counted among his talmidim Rabbi Yitzchak Luria (Arizal) (Arizal's uncle asked Radvaz
        for one of his best talmidim to tutor his brilliant nephew, Rabbi Betzalel was recommended
        and he tutored Arizal for six years) and Rabbi Shlomo Adeni (Meleches Shlomo). When
        Radvaz went to Eretz Yisrael, at the age of thirty six, Rabbi Betzalel was elected to succeed
        him as the chief rabbi of Egypt.</p>
        <p>Soon after being appointed, Rabbi Betzalel became involved in a controversy which created
        quite a storm. The controversy centred around the succession to the title of "Nagid".</p>
        <p>"Nagid" was the title of the president of Egyptian Jewry. For six centuries it was borne by a
        noble family. When the family was no longer worthy of the authority and honour, the
        succession was decided by the Jewish council of Constantinople, who bestowed it upon one
        of their own outstanding members in recognition of valuable services.</p>
        <p>When the old Nagid died, the council sent Yaakov ben Chaim of the noble family of Talmid
        to succeed as Nagid. About the same time, Sultan Suleiman sent Mahmed Pasha as his
        governor for Egypt.</p>
        <p>On the first Shabbos, the leaders of the Cairo Jewish community, with Rabbi Betzalel at their
        head, visited the Nagid to offer him their respects and welcome. Yaakov Talmid was
        unfriendly towards the distinguished visitors, as though he wanted to let them know that they
        were subordinate to him. Rabbi Betzalel was deeply hurt, for he saw in the open insult an
        insult to the Torah. He let Yaakov Talmid know that he had committed a serious offence. The
        enraged Nagid denounced Rabbi Betzalel to Mahmed Pasha, accusing him and the leaders
        of Cairo Jewry of insubordination to the Ottoman government.</p>
        <p>When Rabbi Betzalel heard about this, he decided that the position of Nagid had become
        more of a danger than use. He convinced the Pasha that the title of Nagid was undesirable
        since it referred to secular/political rule and was very much like the title of king, which the
        Jewish people ceased to have since they lost their state. The Pasha accepted Rabbi
        Betzalel's view and abolished the title. Yaakov Talmid was now no longer Nagid, but "Gilibi,"
        which means "gentleman," or "sir."</p>
        <p>Whilst the authority of Rabbi Betzalel was upheld, there was a great deal of public
        indignation that it should have been attained at the cost of the title of Nagid. Rabbi Betzalel
        left Cairo and went to Yerushalayim, where he stayed until the death of Yaakov Talmid. He
        then returned to Cairo as chief rabbi of Egypt.</p>
        <p>When, in 5347/1587, a dispute occurred in Yerushalayim over whether talmidei chachamim
        not engaged in business should contribute to the taxes paid by the Jewish community to the
        pasha, and to what extent, Rabbi Betzalel, together with several other rabbis, took the stand
        that talmidei chachamim, compelled by love alone to emigrate to Eretz Yisrael, and being
        scarcely able to support themselves, should be relieved from all taxes.</p>
        <p>Rabbi Betzalel himself traveled to Eretz Yisrael and settled in Yerushalayim, where he was
        recognized as the chief rabbi by both the Sephardim and the Ashkenazim. The conditions in
        Yerushalayim were at this time very critical; and it was mainly due to Rabbi Betzalel's
        influence that the congregations of the city were not dissolved.</p>
        <p>He sent envoys, and even went himself to the Jewish communities in Egypt, Syria and
        Turkey to raise money for the needs of the community in Yerushalayim. In Damascus he
        installed regular annual collections for Yerushalayim, persuading the local Jews to set aside
        Purim as a special day for making contributions, and appointed special gabbaim to be
        responsible for the collections.</p>
        <p>Back in Yerushalayim, the Ashkenazim, who ordinarily did not recognise the jurisdiction of
        the Sephardim, and who, being largely talmidei chachamim, refused to pay the Jews' tax,
        nevertheless bowed to Rabbi Betzalel's authority. The Ashkenazim had to contribute one-
        sixth of the sum that was sent from Europe for their support; otherwise the Sephardim, who
        were on the verge of extreme poverty, would not have been able to remain in Yerushalayim
        under the merciless exploitation of the Turkish pashas. This peaceable arrangement
        between the Ashkenazim and the Sephardim was due solely to the personal influence of
        Rabbi Betzalel; immediately upon his death the Ashkenazim refused to continue to keep
        their pledge.</p>
        <p>Rabbi Betzalel Ashkenazi is known principally as the author of Shitah Mekubetzes. This
        work, as its title indicates, is a collection of commentaries on the greater part of Shas, in the
        style of the ba'alei Tosfos, including much original and foreign material. The great value of
        the Shitah lies principally in the fact that it contains numerous excerpts from Talmudic
        commentaries which have not otherwise been preserved.</p>
        <p>Rabbi Betzalel designed the Shitah to cover the whole of Shas, but it has only been
        published on a few masechtos.</p>

    <h3>Seforim</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Shitah Mekubetzes, a compilation of meforshim of Gemara, taken from the works of
                the Spaniards Ramban, Rashba and Ritva, and from those of the Frenchmen
                Ra'avad, Baruch ben Samuel, Isaac of Chinon, etc. Particularly valuable for
                understanding ba'alei Tosfos, because the work contains some of the older and
                unedited ba'alei Tosfos; besides, commentary of Rabbi Asher ben Yechiel (Rosh)
                and of talmidei Rabeinu Peretz are partly contained in it.</li>
