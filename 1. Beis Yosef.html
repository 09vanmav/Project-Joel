        <p>Rabbi Yosef ben Ephraim Caro was the author of the
        last great codification of Jewish law, the Beis Yosef, and
        its popular analogue, the Shulchan Aruch. To this end
        he is often referred to as HaMechaber and as Maran.
        Rabbi Yosef was born in Toledo in 1488. In 1492, aged
        four, he was expelled from Spain with his family as a
        result of the Alhambra Decree and subsequently settled
        in the Kingdom of Portugal. After the expulsion of the
        Jews from Portugal in 1497, the Ottomans invited the
        Jews to settle within their empire. Rabbi Yosef went with
        his parents, after a brief move to Morocco, to Nikopolis, then a city under Ottoman rule. In
        Nikopol, he received his first instruction from his father, who was himself an eminent
        Talmudist.</p>
        <p>He was married twice, firstly to Isaac Saba's daughter, and, then after her death, to the
        daughter of Hayyim Albalag, both of these men being well-known Talmudists.
        Between 1520 and 1522 Rabbi Yosef settled at Adrianople. He later settled in the city of
        Tzfat/Safed, Ottoman Galilee, where he arrived about 1535, having en route spent several
        years at Salonica (1533) and Istanbul. By 1555, he was already a resident of the village of
        Biriyya near Tzfat, during which year he completed writing the first order of the Shulchan
        Aruch, Orach Chaim.</p>
        <p>For a short while he lived in Nikopol, but decided to make his way to the Eretz Yisrael so that
        he could immerse himself in its sanctity and complete his written works. Passing through
        Salonica, he met the great kabbalist Yosef Taitazak. He continued his journey to the Holy
        Land via Egypt and eventually settled in Safed.</p>
        <p>In Tzfat, he met Rabbi Yaakov Beirav and was soon appointed a member of his rabbinical
        court. Rabbi Beirav exerted great influence upon him, and Rabbi Yosef became an
        enthusiastic supporter of Rabbi Beirav's plans for the reinstitution of semicha (rabbinical
        ordination) which had been in abeyance for over 11 centuries. Rabbi Yosef was one of the
        first he ordained and after Rabbi Beirav's death, Rabbi Yosef tried to perpetuate the scheme
        by ordaining his pupil Rabbi Moshe Alshich, but he finally gave up his endeavours,
        convinced that he could not overcome the opposition to ordination. Rabbi Yosef also
        established a yeshiva where he taught Torah to over 200 students.</p>
        <p>When Rabbi Beirav died, Rabbi Yosef was regarded as his successor, and together with
        Rabbi Moshe di Trani (Mabit) he headed the Rabbinical Court of Tzfat. In fact, by this time,
        the Rabbinical Court of Tzfat had become the central rabbinical court in all of Old Yishuv
        (southern Ottoman Syria), and indeed of the diaspora as well. There was not a single matter
        of national or global importance that did not come to the attention and ruling of the Tzfat Beis
        Din. Its rulings were accepted as final and conclusive, and Rabbi Yosef's halachic decisions
        and clarifications were sought by sages from every corner of the diaspora. He was also
        visited in Tzfat by the great Egyptian scholars of his day, Rabbi David ibn Abi Zimra
        (Radvaz) and Rabbi Yaakov Castro. He came to be regarded as the leader of the entire
        generation.</p>
        <p>In a dramatic testimonial, Rabbi Shlomo Alkabetz testified that in Salonica, Rabbi Yosef had
        become one of the rare individuals who merited to be instructed by a maggid - a private
        angelic teacher - who revealed to him many kabbalistic teachings. The maggid exhorted
        Rabbi Yosef to sanctify and purify himself, and he revealed to him events that would take
        place in the future.</p>
        <p>His reputation during the last thirty years of his life was greater than that of almost any other
        rabbi since Rambam. The Italian Rabbi Azariah dei Rossi, though his views differed widely
        from Rabbi Yosef's, collected money among the rich Italian Jews for the purpose of having a
        work of Rabbi Yosef's printed; and Rabbi Moses Isserles (Rema) compelled the recognition
        of one of Rabbi Yosef's decisions at Krakow, although he had questions on the ruling.
        When some members of the community of Carpentras, France, believed themselves to have
        been unjustly treated by the majority in a matter relating to taxes, they appealed to Rabbi
        Yosef, whose letter was sufficient to restore to them their rights. In the East, his authority
        was, if possible, even greater. His name heads the decree of excommunication directed
        against Daud, Joseph Nasi's agent; and it was Rabbi Yosef who commissioned Elisha
        Gallico to draw up a decree to be distributed among all Jews, ordering that Dei Rossi's
        "Me'or Enayim" be burned. However, Rabbi Yosef died before it was ready for him to sign,
        so the decree was not promulgated, and the rabbis of Mantua contented themselves with
        forbidding the reading of the work by Jews under twenty-five years of age.
        He is buried in Old Cemetery of Tzfat.</p>

        <ol>
        <li>Beis Yosef, a commentary on Arba'ah Turim, the current work of Jewish law in his
        days. In this wor, he shows an astounding mastery over Gemara and the halachic
        literature of the Middle Ages. He felt called upon to systemise the laws and customs
        of Judaism in face of the disintegration caused by the Spanish expulsion.</li>
        <li>Shulchan Aruch, a condensation of his decisions in Beis Yosef. Finished in 1555, this
        code was published in four parts in 1565.</li>
        <li>Kesef Mishneh (written in Nikopol, published Venice, 1574-75), a commentary of
        Rambam's Mishneh Torah by Maimonides. In the introduction, he writes that his goal
        was to quote the source of each law in the Mishneh Torah, and to defend the work
        from the criticisms of Rabbi Abraham ben David (Raavad).</li>
        <li>Bedek haBayis (Salonica, 1605), supplements and corrections to Beis Yosef.</li>

        recorded the nocturnal visits of an angelic being, his heavenly mentor. His visitor
        spurred him to acts of righteousness and even asceticism (self discipline to restrain
        from physical acts of indulgence), encouraged him to study Kabbala, and rebuked him
        for moral laxities.</li>
